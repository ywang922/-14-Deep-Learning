### Evaluate the performance of each model

Finally, use the testing data to evaluate each model and compare the performance.

Use the above to answer the following:

> ##### Which model has a lower loss?

> LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices model has a lower loss, becuase its loss (in window size 10) is 0.0567; on the other hand, LSTM Stock Predictor Using Fear and Greed Index loss (in window size 10) is 0.1747.



> ##### Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

> LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices model tracks the actual values better over time, because the loss was less, and Real Vs. Predicted Prices plot is more accurate than the other model.



> ##### Which window size works best for the model?

>  After comparing both models in window size 1, 5, 10, window size 1 works best for the LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices model. Because window size 1 has the lowest loss (0.0248), and Real Vs. Predicted Prices plot is the most accurate.
